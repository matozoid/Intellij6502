# Intellij6502
An Intellij IDEA plugin to support 6502 assembly programming.

Why?
Because I work in this IDE daily,
and I'm trying to pick up 6502 assembly but found no plugin for it.
Oh no!

At least I want to make it do some highlighting and formatting for assembly files.

Currently there:
* Reasonably okay syntax highlighting for 64tass .asm files.
* CTRL-H toggles the number under the cursor from hex to binary to decimal.

Not there:
* [All of this](https://github.com/matozoid/Intellij6502/issues)
