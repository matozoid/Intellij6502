# IntellijCc65Plugin
An Intellij IDEA plugin to support the CC65 cross assembler.

Why?
Because I work in this IDE daily,
and I'm trying to pick up 6502 assembly but found no plugin for it.
Oh no!

At least I want to make it do some highlighting and formatting for assembly files.

Currently there:
* Reasonably okay syntax hightlighting for .s and .inc files

Not there:
* [All of this](https://github.com/matozoid/IntellijCc65Plugin/issues)

Really, it's the result of going through half of [this documentation](http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/custom_language_support_tutorial.html)
and messing with the grammar until it worked reasonably well.

Do you think it's bad?
Come help improve it!
Open issues and PR's and we'll improve this thing.

(If you're thinking of starting your own or forking this:
please communicate to avoid having multiple plugins that do the same thing in intellij.)
